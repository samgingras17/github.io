## Welcome !

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Economics at the University of Ottawa.
I graduated from the Université de Montréal in April 2021 with a Ph.D. in economics where I specialized in Bayesian econometrics and computational methods.
In my dissertation, I develop posterior simulation methods for Bayesian inference in non-Gaussian state space models and econometrics models for the analysis of financial time series.


My main research interests are in econometrics, Bayesian analysis, time series analysis and statistical computing.
Although most of my current projects are in the field of financial econometrics, particularly on the analysis of high-frequency data, I am a data enthusiast always interested in new applications.
I am especially interested in big data applications and the intersection of econometrics and machine learning.
